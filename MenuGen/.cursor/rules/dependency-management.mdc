# Dependency Management Guidelines

## Requirements.txt Best Practices

- Pin specific versions for reproducibility (e.g., `streamlit==1.28.1`)
- Remove duplicate entries
- Fix typos in package names (e.g., `opencv-python` not `opencv-pythont`)
- Group related packages together with comments
- Include only necessary dependencies

## Recommended Package Structure

```
# Web Framework
streamlit>=1.28.0

# AI/ML Libraries  
torch>=2.0.0
transformers>=4.21.0
diffusers>=0.21.0
accelerate>=0.21.0

# Image Processing
Pillow>=9.0.0
opencv-python>=4.7.0
pytesseract>=0.3.10

# Utilities
numpy>=1.24.0
requests>=2.28.0

# Hugging Face
huggingface_hub>=0.16.0
```

## Import Organization

- Group imports by category: standard library, third-party, local
- Use specific imports when possible (avoid `import *`)
- Handle import errors for optional dependencies
- Use lazy imports for heavy libraries when appropriate

## Version Compatibility

- Test with different Python versions (3.8+)
- Ensure CUDA compatibility for GPU operations
- Document system requirements (tesseract installation)
- Consider cross-platform compatibility issues

## Development vs Production

- Use separate requirement files for different environments
- Include development tools (pytest, black, flake8) in dev requirements
- Document installation steps for system dependencies
- Consider Docker for consistent deployment environments
